Electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are key technologies in advancing sustainable transportation. 
EVs run entirely on electric power, using large batteries and electric motors, and produce zero emissions during operation. They require charging from external power sources, 
such as charging stations, making them ideal for reducing environmental pollution. HEVs combine a traditional internal combustion engine with an electric motor, working together
to enhance fuel efficiency and lower emissions. These vehicles recharge their batteries through regenerative braking and the engine, without needing to be plugged in. PHEVs,
on the other hand, use both an internal combustion engine and a rechargeable battery that can be charged externally. They can operate on electric power for short distances 
before switching to gasoline, providing greater flexibility in fuel options. Collectively, these vehicles are essential for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and cutting down 
greenhouse gas emissions.
